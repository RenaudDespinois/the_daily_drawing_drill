	p I've made this webpage for those who, just like me, can't manage to get out of their drawing exercises routine. I thought it's easier to get to try something new if somebody else tells you to. And if it's done in a nicely designed web page, well, even better!
	p I've tried to make the site the best I could but I may have let pass some bugs, some typos or some poorly google-translated english expressions.
	p The drill generator may also not be that accurate and may offer you to try some inconsistent exercise (please don't be offended if you get the 'draw some fantastic creature from oneself' drill).
	p So if you have any comment, remark or suggestion, please let me know by clicking here:
		img.clickable(id='mailto', src='/images/mailto.png', title='Send mail', width='32px', height='24px', onclick='window.open("mailto:renaud.despinois@gmail.com")', onmouseover='this.src="/images/mailto_hover.png"', onmouseout='this.src="/images/mailto.png"')
	p I really hope this site can help someone out there!
